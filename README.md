Hey All

Sean here, I just graduated with a business marketing degree hoping that would help me get into the analytical world. Unfortunatly, my degree screams "sales" to everyone who reads it despite me only taking quantative courses. I have decided to take matters into my own hands and learn programming until I save up enough to get my MS in data analytics.
